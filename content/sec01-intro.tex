\section{Εισαγωγή}\label{sec:intro}

The Tufte-\LaTeX\ document classes define a style similar to the
style Edward Tufte uses in his books and handouts.  Tufte's style is known
for its extensive use of sidenotes, tight integration of graphics with
text, and well-set typography.  This document aims to be at once a
demonstration of the features of the Tufte-\LaTeX\ document classes
and a style guide to their use.
